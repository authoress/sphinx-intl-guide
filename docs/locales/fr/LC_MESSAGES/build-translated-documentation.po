"`Sphinx documentation <https://www.sphinx-"
"doc.org/en/master/usage/advanced/intl.html>`_ recommends using two "
"commands in sequence to build the translated documentation (in our "
"example, in Russian)::"

"The first command sets the language of the documentation, and the second "
"runs the build."

"The problem with this method is that Sphinx writes the output to the "
"directory specified in the make.bat file, and this directory is the same "
"for all languages."

#: ../../build-translated-documentation.rst:22
msgid ""
"Therefore, we will use another method, which implies more control over "
"various build parameters. We will run `sphinx-build <https://www.sphinx-"
"doc.org/en/master/man/sphinx-build.html>`_ directly and specify the "
"language and the build directory in a single command."

"Before building the new documentation, you can remove everything from the"
" **_build/html** directory, as we don't need the previously generated "

"To build the Russian documentation with sphinx-build, run the following "
"command::"

"This command tells Sphinx to build html documentation (``-b html``) in "
"Russian (``-D language=ru``) and put the result in the "
"**_build/html/ru/** directory (``. _build/html/ru/``). The command also "
"specifies the directory for doctrees files (``-d _build/doctrees/ru/``), "
"otherwise Sphinx writes the doctrees files to the same directory as html "
"files."

"If you now look into the **locale/ru/LC_MESSAGES** and "
"**locale/pt_BR/LC_MESSAGES** directories, you can see that index.mo and "
"easter-egg.mo files have appeared. Sphinx generates these binaries from "
".po files and then uses .mo files to build the output. You don't need to "
"do anything with the .mo files, just ignore them."
